# NONGD

NONGD is a song manager for Geometry Dash. It swaps Newgrounds songs with their NONG counterparts.

## What is NONG?

NONG stands for **Not On NewGrounds**. Basically, it means any song that is not on Newgrounds that was replaced manually through the game files. 

NONGs have always been a hassle to manage, because some level creators use popular Newgrounds song IDs and replace them with a NONG. So you have to swap those song files around quite a bit if you play a level with the Newgrounds song and a level with a NONG song.

## Enter NONGD

NONGD stands for **Not On NewGrounds, Duh**. It automates the process of swapping NONGs with their Newgrounds counterparts. It even allows for multiple NONGs on the same song ID.

## How do I get NONGS?

You can use your own MP3 files and add them to any song ID you want, or alternatively, you can download songs directly from Song File Hub. All of that packed nicely inside of a popup. Just click the song name in the level view screen and add your songs!

All song data is fetched from **Song File Hub**. You can find it [here](https://songfilehub.com).
