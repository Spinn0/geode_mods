A Geometry Dash Mod for adding more tools such as Notifications, auto-song mute, game fixes & more!
![Mod Example](gdutilsdevs.gdutils/Screenshot_1.png)
# Features
## Realtime Notifications
* This includes any new levels being **rated**, new **daily levels**, and new **weekly levels!**
* Notifications are **highly customizable**, you can set the __position__, __size__, and __how long they can stay on screen!__
* You can also set when notifications **should appear** or **not appear**! This includes __being shown in levels__, __in the editor__, __etc__.
## Auto-Mute Spotify (or any application)
* Allows you to **auto mute Spotify** when you are __playing a level__, __playtesting in the editor__, and more!
* You're also able to set **any application** to be muted, not just Spotify!
* **IMPORTANT for Mac Users:** Geometry Dash may request access to "System Events" and another app for muting Spotify or another application. This allows the game to detect running applications.
## Extra additions to Friends List
* The additions added include being able to **search usernames** if you have a long friend list, or using the **scroll buttons**!
